Objectives of Hello, World
--------------------------

The goal of this module is to have you write a simple Hello, World application. By the end of this module, you should be able to identify main parts of an app. You should also be able to verify that your tools are setup properly and that you can run the application on an Android device, either physical or emulated. Topics covered include:

* Android SDK: How to set it up and what it consists of
* About Eclipse: The power of the tools
* Creating a new Android project
* Anatomy of a project: What are all the moving parts
* Running the app: Emulator, real device, tools to monitor them both

Android SDK
-----------
.Android SDK Tools

Android SDK is all you need. Get it from d.android.com[http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html]
It is supported for Mac, Linux, or Windows. About equally.

You also need JDK.

And most people tend to use Eclipse[http://eclipse.org], a powerful and feature-rich tool.


Create New Project
------------------

Use the Eclipse tool to create a new Android project.

Here are some key constructs:

|Project  | Eclipse construct
|Target   | minimum to run
|App name | whatever
|Package  | Java package
|Activity | Java class

Anatomy of An App
-----------------

Java Code + XML and Other Resources + Manifest File = Android App

Run It!
-------
.Emulator

Android is agnostic to emulator versus a real device. For the most part.

Emulator is not a simulator!

Lately, for serious development, you may want to have a real device.


Quiz
----

. Where do you get the SDK from?
. Once you download it and install the initial SDK, what next?
. What are some of the main tools in the SDK?
. What does ADT stand for, and where do you get it from?
. What are three main parts of an app?
. What is an Android APK?
. What is the difference between an emulator and a simulator?
. How do you run your app on a real device?


Summary of Hello, World
-----------------------

The goal of this module was to create a simple Android app, to dissect it and analyze various parts that make up an app, and to build and run it on an Android device.

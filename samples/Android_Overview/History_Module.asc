Devices that have “With Google” add-on feature a set of Google’s proprietary applications, such as Google Play (aka Android Market), Google Maps, Gmail, Gtalk, and many others.

OEMs and carriers typically enter into a licensing agreement with Google in order to distribute Google version of Android.

Android Fragmentation?
----------------------

Android Compatibility Test Suite:
Defines “Android Compatible”
Prevents incompatible releases
Provides self testing

Fragmentations lines include:

* Versions of Android

* Device capabilities

Best practices in app development eliminate these issues. CTS ensures compliance.

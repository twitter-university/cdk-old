Objectives of Android Security
------------------------------

The goal of this module is to provide high level overview of how Android security is architected. By the end of this module, you should know how apps are sandboxed and how kernel enforces security rights. Topics covered include:

* Security design overview
* Application sandboxing
* Using permissions
* Declaring permissions

Security Overview
-----------------

No app can adversely impact other apps, user, or OS

* Cannot read/write user’s private data 
* Cannot read other app’s data 
* Cannot perform network access 
* Cannot keep device awake, and so on 

Each application is its own sandbox:

* To share resources, apps need to request permissions 
* User must grant permissions at install time 

Linux manages security:

* Not up to Dalvik (Java) but outsourced to Linux 
*	Native code (NDK) also adheres to sandboxing 

Application Sandboxing
----------------------
.Sandboxing

An application is an island on its own.

It contains any number of Activities, Services, Receivers and Providers.

It has its own file system, database, place to store native libraries. 

No other app can access any of its data without prior permission.


Permissions
-----------
.Permissions

A component that does something potentially dangerous can require callers to have permission to access it.

App that wants to use it must have user grant it permission.

Permissions are granted at install time. All or nothing. Forever.


Quiz
----
. What is the main premise of Android security?
. Who enforces the sandboxing?
. What if apps what to connect to one another?
. What are the permission levels?


Summary of Android Security
---------------------------

This module was a high level overview of how security in Android works. You show know that Linux kernel is the sole enforcer of the security rights, and that each app in Android runs in its own process.

= Marakana Courseware Development Kit =

Marakana CDK is a set of tools, templates, documentation, and best practices for creating Marakana Beautiful Courseware.

== Requirements ==

CDK is based on http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Asciidoc]. As such, it requires *Python* to be installed. Also, it currently uses http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/[GNU Source-Highlight], which also should be installed.

Make sure CDK directory is in your path. In Bash, for example:

[source,shell]
----
export PATH=$PATH:YOUR_PATH_TO/cdk
----

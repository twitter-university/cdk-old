= Marakana Courseware Development Kit =

Marakana CDK is a set of tools, templates, documentation, and best practices for creating Marakana Beautiful Courseware.

== Requirements ==

CDK is based on http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Asciidoc]. As such, it requires *Python* to be installed. Also, it currently uses http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/[GNU Source-Highlight], which also should be installed.

Make sure CDK directory is in your path. In Bash, for example:

----
export PATH=$PATH:YOUR_PATH_TO/cdk
----

On OSX, you could just put the line above in your `~/.bash_profile`.

== Tools ==

`asc`::
The main tool is `asc`. It processes an AsciiDoc file and creates an output that adheres to Marakana Beautiful Courseware standards.

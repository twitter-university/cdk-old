[[CDK_Setup]]
== Requirements for Setting Up CDK ==

You need Python. If running on a platform other than OSX, you also need http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/[GNU Source-Highlight].

Make sure CDK directory is in your path. In Bash, for example:

----
export PATH=$PATH:YOUR_PATH_TO/cdk
----

On OSX, you could just put the line above in your `~/.bash_profile`.

== Tools ==

`asc`::
The main tool is `asc`. It processes an AsciiDoc file and creates an output that adheres to Marakana Beautiful Courseware standards.

`post`::
Creates Marakana Stream-ready posts from a module.

`ascidoc`::
This is the standard AsciiDoc processor, included as part of CDK. You can use it to pass in other styles, or arguments to it. All other tools depend on `asciidoc`.


== CDK Goodies ==

Templates::
Contains courseware templates, such as a course, a module, and a slide.

TextMate::
Here, you will find the TextMate AsciiDoc bundle, as well as our extensions to Textmate to help with Beautiful Courseware development. The easiest way to add these bundles to your TextMate is the following:
+
----
cd "~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles"; 
ln -s YOUR_PATH_TO/cdk/textmate/Marakana.tmbundle . ; 
ln -s YOUR_PATH_TO/cdk/textmate/AsciiDoc.tmbundle . ;
----

TextMate2::
For TextMate2, you need to link to a https://github.com/zuckschwerdt/asciidoc.tmbundle[different bundle], as well as the CDK bundle that contains many useful shortcuts specific to CDK, such as course->, module->, slide->, and question-> tab triggers that fill out the snippets of code as specified in the template folder. To enable this bundle:
+
----
cd "~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles"; 
ln -s YOUR_PATH_TO/cdk/textmate2/asciidoc.tmbundle . ;
ln -s YOUR_PATH_TO/cdk/textmate2/CDK.tmbundle . ;
----
+
Also, you have to add `PATH` variable to point to your CDK directory by going to TextMate->Preferences->Variables.
+
If you don't like TextMate2 opening the preview in split pane, and prefer a new window, run the following in your Terminal:
+
----
defaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview htmlOutputPlacement window
----

== Beautiful Courseware Building Blocks ==

Beautiful Courseware consists of the following:

* Course
* Modules
* Slides

== Course Building Blocks ==

A *Course* is a collection of modules. Each course should have clearly stated objectives and summary.

Course  should have its own folder named _Course_Name_. There should be a main course file, _Course_Name.asc_ that includes all the other module files.

For course file template, see `[CDK]/template/Course.asc`

== Module Building Blocks ==

A *Module* is a self-contained unit of knowledge. It is usually couple of hours of learning material in length, but this can vary greatly. As a rule of thumb, a module longer than a day should probably be split up. 

Each module should have clearly states objectives and summary as well. Modules consist of slides.

Module should live in a file _Module_Name.asc_. Each module should be stand-alone so that modules could be combined into courses easily.

For module file template, see `[CDK]/template/Module.asc`

== Slide Building Blocks ==

A *Slide* is a single topic. It should have the main section stating a point. This main section is a mental hook - something that communicates the idea quickly. Images are great as mental hooks, or short text.

All supporting text can follow on below and can be as long as couple of screens worth of supporting text, code, images. If you want to be able to toggle them on/off during presentation, you can wrap the supporting text in an AsciiDoc side note block.

For an example of a slide, see `[CDK]/template/Slide.asc`

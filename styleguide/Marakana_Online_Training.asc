== Share The Code

_Provides for easy way to follow what you do_


[options="incremental"]
* Setup a public repo
* Instructor's workflow, first time:
+
----
mkdir SOME_WORKSPACE
cd SOME_WORKSPACE
git init
touch README
git add README
git commit -m 'first commit'
git remote add origin git@github.com:marakana/YOUR_NEW_REPO.git
git push -u origin master
----
+
* From there on, instructor just needs to do the following to push the changes:
+
----
git add NEW_FILES
git commit -m 'What changed'
git push origin master
----

[options="incremental"]
* Student workflow, first time:
+
----
git clone git://github.com/marakana/android-intro-feb2012.git
----
+
* Student workflow, from there on:
+
----
git pull origin master
----


Here's an example of a repo:
https://github.com/marakana/bootcamp-feb2012

[options="incremental"]
=== Why?
Students can clone the repo, they can run their own branch, or can simply view the code online and download tarballs.

Git also provides for an audit trail of all the modifications to the project - it makes it easy to follow the evolution, and pick up at any point should one miss a session.



== Record the Session
_Knowing it's recorded eliminates anxiety_

* Use iShowU HD, or similar: I record full screen with YouTube-HD setting in iShowU.
* One recording per session

== Suggest Breaks

* For 3-hour (1/2-day) sessions: 5-minutes at top of each hour
* For full-day classes, I'd do 1-hour in the middle of the day, plus two 2 15-minute breaks at in the morning and the afternoon, making it a total of four sessions.

== GoToWebinar

_Get familiar with the tool before the training!_

* Make sure you download it and set it up well before the class
* Make sure you have the login information for the presenter before the class!
* Try to log in first day at least 20-30 minutes before the training to debug any connection issues with Julie
* I tend to like using dual screen: one for GoToMeeting windows so I can see questions people ask, and the other one to share with students (make sure you're recording the screen you share, not the auxiliary one)
* GoToWebinar seems to be limited in terms of what participants can do. I usually just use Questions feature to let them ask questions, but I answer them verbally.
* You can try to un-mute all the participants so they can participate, but if there's noise on the line and you can't identify the offender, you may have to mute them all.

Julie is going to be there 1/2 hour before the start and 1/2 after the start of the first session to help you, and the participants debug any issues.
